# Connect Four

In this game players take turns dropping their pieces into one of seven columns that have six rows of slots. The first player to get their pieces into four slots that are vertically, horizontally, or diagonally contiguous wins the game. <br>
The code is based on jQuery, a Javascript library, HTML and CSS and the main challenges behind it were to figure out the diagonal win possibilities as well as animating the falling pieces and the ones that show which player has currently the turn. <br> <br>
